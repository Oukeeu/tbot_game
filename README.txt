# Telegram bot developed on python to play the game "Mafia"

This telegram bot was developed for the purpose of a student project, as a project work of a first year student at St. Petersburg University.
The bot is an application for playing mafia in chats and publishers of all sizes.
Here is part of the code, as my task as a developer was to do only half of the logic:

1) Create and register the bot in Telegram.
2) Add basic functionality for working with the bot.
3) Make the basic logic of the game start:
  3.1 Allocation of players to roles depending on the scale of chat and the number of players who participated.
  3.2 Restrict access to game management to people who did not participate.
  3.3 Add logic to the transition to day and night.
  3.4 Add coordination between players with "mafia" status.
  3.5 Add a secret informing of each player about the events that happened to all of them.
